# TicTacToe

###TicTacToe

##Requirements

* Create a tictactoe game that records moves of two players.
* Using event listeners to trigger an event when the user clicks on a specific square.
* Once the player has 3 in a row in any direction allow the player to win the game.
* If a game has no winners and all possible moves are made then end game as a draw.
* Have a restart button which will reload the page if the players want to start again.

##logical thinking

I had to break up the TicTacToe game into smaller task. I had to create an empty array which will record the different moves. I had to create function to which would check the different moves.

## Winnng conditions

If the user does manage to win the game a alert message would appear on the screen telling which player has won the game.

## Draw conditions

If there does seem to be a draw there will be another alert message that will tell the players that the game has ended as a draw.
